The entire concept is built upon creating templates for platforms that could be dynamically edited in real-time based on data gathered from an e-form. To make this achievable, an external list must be established, containing mappings between privileged groups, applications, and the ID of the connector component object that facilitates access to such applications.

In the future, there might be a need for a fourth mapping, allowing the selection of the most suitable PSM server farm to handle the application optimally. However, for the sake of simplicity, this matter is not the focus of this analysis.
